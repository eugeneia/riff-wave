# riff-wave

**Description:**

A library for reading and writing *WAVE files*. Reading support is
limited. Sanely formatted WAVE files such as produced by
[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) or *riff-wave* itself are
handled just fine but there are many files out in the wild that will make
it barf.

**Documentation:**

* [API documentation](http://mr.gy/software/riff-wave/api.html)

**Dependencies:**

* [bytes](http://github.com/eugeneia/bytes)
